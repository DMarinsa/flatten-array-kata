# flatten-array-kata

To run the test use ```npm run test```


## Additional considerations

This problem could be solved using libraries like underscore or lodash could be a possibility

An additional possibility could be to use flat method from js with recursivity if we don't know the depth of the flattening or using 
```
const flattenedArray = arr.flat(3);
```
if we know the depth of the array.

We could use a stack to solve this issue without using recursivity as well.
